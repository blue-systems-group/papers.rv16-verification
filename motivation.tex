\section{Background and Motivating Example}
\label{sec:motivation}

The problem of validating wireless protocol implementation using sniffers arises
during testing a popular game controller. To meet the low latency and low power
consumption goals, custom wireless communication protocol was designed. The
protocol specification was then handed over to wireless chipset vendors for
implementation, which is common industry practice. However, neither
implementation details nor trace collection capabilities are provided in the
shipped firmware due to Intellectual Property constraints and device resource
limitation. Hence using sniffers to validate the protocol implementation is the
natural and only option.

We developed a tool to validate certain protocol properties in the sniffer
trace, yet often found outrageous amounts of false alarms due to the
incompleteness of the sniffer traces, making the tool virtually useless.

To better understand the incompleteness of sniffer trace, consider the IEEE
802.11 (as known as \wifi{}) transmitter (DUT) state machine shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dot11_tx_ta}. After the DUT sends $DATA_i$---a data packet with
sequence number $i$ ($s_0\rightarrow s_1)$, it starts a timer and waits for the
acknowledgment packet---$Ack$. Either it receives $Ack$ within time $T_o$
($s_1\rightarrow s_0$), or it sends $DATA'_i$---retransmission of $DATA_i$
($s_1\rightarrow s_2$). Similarly, either it receives the $Ack$ within $T_o$
($s_2\rightarrow s_0$) or aborts transmission and moves on to next
packet\footnote{We assume in this example that the DUT will retry at most once
to succinctly present the state machine. In practice, multiple
retransmissions will be made before aborting.} ($s_2\rightarrow s_1$).

\end{figure}

Given the DUT's internal log of packet transmission and reception
events, it is trivial to feed such log into the state machine in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dot11_tx_ta} and validate the correctness of DUT's protocol
implementation. In this paper, however, we assume the DUT implementation is a
black box and its internal events are not available. And we seek to validate the
DUT implementation using sniffers.

Two fundamental properties in wireless communication bring uncertainty
to sniffer's observation: packet loss and physical diversity. The sniffer could
either missing packets from the DUT (packet loss), or overhear packets that are
sent to but missed by the DUT (physical diversity).

    the chronological sequence of packets sent by the DUT and the receiver.
    $Tr_{DUT}$ is DUT's internal events. $Tr_1$ and $Tr_2$ are two possible observations
  of the sniffer.}

\end{figure}

Consider a correct packet exchange sequence and a few sniffer observations
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sniffer_in_middle}. The DUT first sends
$DATA_0$.  Suppose the receiver receives $DATA_0$ and sends the $Ack$ which the
DUT does not receive. Eventually the DUT's timer fires and it sends $DATA'_0$.
This time the $DATA'_0$ reaches receiver and the DUT also receives the $Ack$.

In first possible sniffer observation $Tr_1$ where the sniffer
\textit{overhears} the first $Ack$ packet, a validation \textit{uncertainty}
arises when the sniffer sees the $DATA'_0$: was the previous $Ack$ missed by the
DUT or is there a bug in DUT which causes it to retransmit even after receiving
the $Ack$?

Similarly, consider another possible sniffer observation $Tr_2$
where both the $DATA'_0$ and $Ack$ packets were missed by the sniffer.  During
this period of time, it appears the DUT neither receives $Ack$ for $DATA_0$ nor
sends $DATA'_0$.  Again, without any additional information it is impossible to
disambiguate between the sniffer missing certain packets and a bug in DUT's
retransmission logic.

Informally, the question we set out to answer in this paper is: given the
protocol monitor state machine and the sniffer's
observation with inherent uncertainty, how to validate that the DUT behaves as
specified?

\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case}

We present case studies on applying our validation framework on two
protocols implemented in the \ns{} network simulator: 802.11 data transmission
and ARF rate control algorithm. The goal is to demonstrate how our framework can
avoid false alarms and report true violations on incomplete sniffer traces and
report true violations.

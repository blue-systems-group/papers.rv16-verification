\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case}

We present three case studies on applying our validation framework on protocols
implemented in the \ns{} network simulator (802.11 data transmission
and ARF rate control). The goal is to demonstrate how our framework can avoid
raising false alarms on incomplete sniffer traces and report true violations.

\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case}

We present three case studies on applying our validation framework on
protocols implemented in the \ns{} network simulator~\cite{ns3}
(802.11 data transmission and ARF rate control), and on real world
traces of a custom wireless implementation. The goal is to demonstrate
how our framework can avoid raising false alarms on incomplete sniffer
traces and report true violations.

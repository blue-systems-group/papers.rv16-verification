\subsection{ARF Rate Control Algorithm}
\label{subsec:arf}

We report a bug found in NS-3 ARF~\cite{kamerman1997wavelan} implementation
which causes the sender gets stuck at a lower rate even after enough number of
consecutive successes. The bug was detected using the sniffer trace and
confirmed using the DUT trace and source code inspection. The details of this
bug can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:arf}.
%\shuvendu{Since this is a simulator, why do we need
%uncertainty to find this bug? We can find it with complete traces as well.}

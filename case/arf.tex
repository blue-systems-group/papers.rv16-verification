\subsection{ARF Rate Control Algorithm}
\label{subsec:arf}

We report a bug found in NS-3 ARF~\cite{kamerman1997wavelan} implementation
which causes the sender stuck at a lower rate even after enough number of
consecutive successes. This bug also exists in the NS-3 implementation of
Adaptive ARF (AARF) algorithm~\cite{lacage2004ieee}, which is similar to ARF but
use Binary Exponential Backoff to adjust the thresholds dynamically. The pseudo
code implementation of AARF in~\cite{lacage2004report} also suffers the same
problem.

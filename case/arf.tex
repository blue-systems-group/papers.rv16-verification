\subsection{ARF Rate Control Algorithm}
\label{subsec:arf}

We report a bug found in NS-3 ARF~\cite{kamerman1997wavelan} implementation
which causes the sender gets stuck at a lower rate even after enough number of
consecutive successes. The details of this bug can be found in
Appendix~\ref{app:arf}.

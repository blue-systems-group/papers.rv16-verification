\subsection{ARF Rate Control Algorithm}
\label{subsec:arf}

We report a bug found in NS-3 ARF~\cite{kamerman1997wavelan} implementation
which causes the sender to get stuck at a lower rate even after enough number of
consecutive successes. The bug was detected using sniffer traces and
confirmed by both the DUT trace and source code inspection.
%The details of this bug can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:arf}.
%\shuvendu{Since this is a simulator, why do we need
%uncertainty to find this bug? We can find it with complete traces as well.}

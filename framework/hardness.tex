\subsection{Problem Hardness}
\label{subsec:hard}

In this section, we show that the VERIFICATION problem is NP-complete. In
fact, the problem is still NP-complete even with only one type of augmented
transitions.

Recall that Type-1 transitions are added because the sniffer may miss packets.
Suppose there exists a special sniffer that is able to capture \textit{every}
packet ever transmitted, then only Type-2 transitions are needed since the
sniffer may still overhear packets sent to the DUT.

Similarly, suppose another special sniffer that would not overhear any packets
sent to the DUT. In this case, only Type-1 transitions are needed to infer
missing packets.

We refer the augmented state machine that only have Type-0 and Type-1
transitions as $S^+_1$, and the augmented state machine only have Type-0 and
Type-2 transitions as $S^+_2$. And we show that each subproblem of determining
trace satisfiability is NP-complete.

\begin{problem}
  VALIDATION-1\\
  Given that $Tr\setminus Tr_{DUT}=\emptyset$.\\
  \textbf{instance} Checker state machine $S$ and sniffer trace $Tr$.\\
  \textbf{question} Does $S^+_1$ accept $Tr$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  VALIDATION-2\\
  Given that $Tr_{DUT} \subset Tr$.\\
  \textbf{instance} Checker state machine $S$ and sniffer trace $Tr$.\\
  \textbf{question} Does $S^+_2$ accept $Tr$?
\end{problem}

\begin{lemma}
  Both VALIDATION-1 and VALIDATION-2 are NP-complete.
\end{lemma}%
(Proof in Appendix~\ref{app:lemma2})

We now turn to the general validation problem with normal sniffers that could
either miss or overhear packets.

\begin{theorem}
  VALIDATION is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}
